### Today's Lecture Takeaways:  

  

   

  

1. **GUI vs CLI:**  

  

   - In the computer world, you interact with systems in two main ways: Graphical User Interface (GUI) and Command-Line Interface (CLI).  

  

   - GUI is like using apps with pictures and buttons, easy to understand. CLI is like typing specific commands which need to be learned.  

  

   - GUI is simpler for most people, but CLI can do more things and is faster.  

  

     

  

2. **Version Control System (VCS):**  

  

   - Version control, also known as source control, helps manage changes to software code.  

  

   - VCS tools help software teams work better and faster by keeping track of code changes over time.  

  

   - Git is an example of a VCS that lets many people work on code together, keeping track of who changed what.  

  

   

  

3. **Git Commands and GitHub:**  

  

   - Git commands are like special words you type to control Git.  

  

   - Some common Git commands include `pwd` to show where you are, `mkdir` to make a new folder, and `git init` to start tracking changes.  

  

   - GitHub is a website where you can save and share your code with others.  

  

   - The ACP cycle (Add, Commit, Push) is important for keeping track of changes: you add your changes, write a note about them, and then share them with others on GitHub.
